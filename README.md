In this project I have used WebSockets to connect players, create a lobby/ waiting room in which they will wait for the other player to join, as soon as another player is available in the queue, both players are matched and game starts.

When a game starts that randomly chooses which player will choose play first.

Kept check on valdation of move from both the players before broadcasting the move to the other player.
